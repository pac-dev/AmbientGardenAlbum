 * Sparse soprano. This is a simple vocal synth, starting with a sawtooth wave
 * combined with noise, which are then fed into a formant filter bank. This
 * patch just plays the note that's given as parameter.
 * 
 * Audio-rate code is written in Faust and can be found in the faust directory.
 * 
 * This file contains sequencing, envelopes, and other control code.
